# Swift Window Switcher

Alfred Workflow for switching between windows or browser/ iTerm tabs.

## Prerequisites

1. To make this workflow work, don't forget to allow Alfred to screen recording (Security & Privacy â†’ Accessibility).

2. This version requires [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon). You need to install the app and its command line tool, if you haven't.

    - Install Hammerspoon's cli:

    ```
    hs.ipc.cliInstall()
    ```

## Modifications

- Use nice and neat JSON output.

- In 'window mode', list only windows, including browser windows. Leave the tabs to 'tab mode'.

- Use [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) to manipulate windows and apps, which is more efficient and accurate.

- Use Alfred's result filtering and improve matching strings.

## Credits

> Inspration is taken from [Windows Switcher](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/9326-a-simple-windows-switcher/) workflow from Emanuele MunafÃ² (kudozz! ðŸ”¥).

## Catalina Users

Make sure that Alfred is added to "Security & Privacy -> Screen Recording".
The context on why that is needed is [here](https://github.com/mandrigin/AlfredSwitchWindows/issues/31).

My little "weekend" project.
Alfred workflow to switch between open windows in the system and Safari tabs.

## Features
- Switch between the open windows using Alfred
- Switch between the Safari tabs using Alfred
- Very quick comparing to the alternative implementations because of the native search implementation.

## Releases

You can download the ready-to-use `.workflow` files from [the releases page](https://github.com/mandrigin/AlfredSwitchWindows/releases).

## Source code

You can start exploring the source code at [main.swift](EnumWindows/main.swift)

### `ScriptingBridge` in Swift

It turns out, that `ScriptingBridge` implementation is not fully compatible with Swift.

(Classes like `SafariApplication` are not imported, so we can't use them).

One of the possible solutions to this issue is demonstrated in [BrowserApplication.swift](EnumWindows/BrowserApplication.swift)
(used for both Safari and Chrome automation)

**UPD:** There is a better solution using `optional` protocol methods:
```swift
@objc fileprivate enum PlayerState: NSInteger {
    case stopped = 0x6b505353
    case playing = 0x6b505350
    case paused = 0x6b505370
    case fastForwarding = 0x6b505346
    case rewinding = 0x6b505352
};

@objc fileprivate protocol iTunesBridge {
    @objc optional var isRunning: Bool { get }
    @objc optional var playerState: PlayerState { get }
    @objc optional func pause() -> Void
}

extension SBApplication: iTunesBridge{}

guard let app = SBApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.iTunes") as? iTunesBridge else {
   return
}

let isPlaying = app.playerState == .playing

NSLog("isPlaying: \(isPlaying)")
```
